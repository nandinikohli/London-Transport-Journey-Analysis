# Transport Journey Analysis

## Project Overview
The **Transport Journey Analysis** project investigates public transport journey data from Transport for London (TfL). The aim is to analyze journey patterns across various transport types, identify peak travel periods, and highlight trends to assist in transport planning and decision-making.

## Objectives
- Identify the most popular transport types based on total journey counts.
- Determine the five months and years with the highest journey volumes for Emirates Airline.
- Find the five years with the lowest journey volumes for Underground and Docklands Light Railway (DLR) services.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL**: Employed complex SQL queries to extract, aggregate, and analyze data from the TfL JOURNEYS table within a Snowflake database.
- **Snowflake**: Utilized for efficient database management and handling large datasets.
